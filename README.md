For Lethbridge developers and experts that are a _bit wise_.

## Hello Lethbridge,

Over the past 10-years I've met a number of awesome local people.
People who are building awesome companies, products, tools, and talent.
People with the skills necessary for a digital-first world we seem to be entering.

In this time I've also noticed two things.
1. These leaders are generous to share, educate, and mentor.
2. There are few to no spaces for technical leaders to connect.

I propose we fix that with a:
Low commitment and low pressure, non-formal community for local tech leaders and learners to meet, share, and learn.

Coffee, breakfast, lunch, beers, whatever.
Just a group of builders who want to talk about tools, technologies, and ways of the future.
